  "body": "# heemod - Health Economic Evaluation MODelling\r\n\r\n`heemod` is an `R` toolset for health economic evaluation modelling. It aims to provide a simple and consistent interface for Markov models specification and comparison (for decision trees or cohort simulation). Non-homogeneous Markov models (with time varying properties) are supported.\r\n\r\nMost of the analyses presented in [Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198526629.do) can be performed with `heemod`. See [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/i-reproduction.html) for an exact reproduction of the analyses from the book.\r\n\r\nYou can install:\r\n\r\n  * the latest released version from CRAN with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"heemod\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * the latest development version from github with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"pierucci/heemod@devel\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n  * Graphical user interface with `shiny`.\r\n  * Time-varying transition probabilities.\r\n  * Time-varying values attached to states.\r\n  * Microsimulation-like models.\r\n  * Probabilistic uncertainty analysis.\r\n  * Deterministic sensitivity analysis.\r\n  * Multiple state membership correction methods (life-table, half-cycle, etc.).\r\n  * Demographic analysis to compute population-level results.\r\n  * Heterogeneity analysis.\r\n  * Parallel computing support.\r\n\r\n## Learning heemod\r\n\r\nTo get started read the intro [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/a-introduction.html).\r\n\r\nSpecific analysis examples (mostly inspired from Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation) can be found in the following vignettes:\r\n\r\n  * [Homogeneous Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/b-homogeneous.html).\r\n  * [Non-homogeneous Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/c-non-homogeneous.html).\r\n  * [Probabilistic uncertainty analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/d-probabilistic.html).\r\n  * [Deterministic sensitivity analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/e-sensitivity.html).\r\n  * [Heterogeneity & Demographic analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/g-heterogeneity.html).\r\n  * [Running the model from tabular input](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/h-tabular.html).\r\n\r\n## Devs\r\n\r\n[Kevin Zarca](http://www.urc-eco.fr/Kevin-ZARCA,402) and [Antoine Filipović-Pierucci](https://pierucci.org).\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n  * [Matthew Wiener](https://github.com/MattWiener)\r\n  * [Zdenek Kabat](https://github.com/zkabat)\r\n  * [Vojtech Filipec](https://github.com/vojtech-filipec)\r\n",

{"name":"heemod","tagline":"Models for Health Economic Evaluation","body":"# heemod - Health Ecomomic Evaluation MODelling\r\n\r\n`heemod` is an `R` toolset for health ecomomic evaluation modelling. It aims to provide a simple and consistent interface for Markov models specification and comparison. Non-homogeneous Markov models (with time varying properties) are supported.\r\n\r\nMost of the analyses presented in [Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198526629.do) can be performed with `heemod`.\r\n\r\nThis package is still a *beta* version.\r\n\r\nYou can install:\r\n\r\n  * the latest released version from CRAN with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"heemod\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * the latest development version from github with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"pierucci/heemod\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n  * Graphical user interface with `shiny`.\r\n  * Time-varying transition probabilities.\r\n  * Time-varying values attached to states.\r\n  * Heterogeneity analysis.\r\n  * Probabilistic incertitude analysis.\r\n  * Deterministic sensitivity analysis.\r\n  * Multiple state membership correction methods (life-table, half-cycle...).\r\n\r\n## Learning heemod\r\n\r\nTo get started read the intro [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/introduction.html).\r\n\r\nSpecific analysis examples (mostly inspired from Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation) can be found in the following vignettes:\r\n\r\n  * [Homogeneous Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/homogeneous.html).\r\n  * [Non-homogeneous Markov model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/non-homogeneous.html).\r\n  * [Probabilistic incertitude analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/probabilistic.html).\r\n  * [Deterministic sensitivity analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/heemod/vignettes/sensitivity.html).\r\n  \r\n## Graphical user interface\r\n\r\nRun the graphical user interface with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nrun_shiny()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Future developments\r\n\r\nUpcoming vignettes:\r\n\r\n  * Heterogeneity analysis in `vignette(\"heterogeneity\", package = \"heemod\")`.\r\n\r\n## Devs\r\n\r\n[Kevin Zarca](http://www.urc-eco.fr/Kevin-ZARCA,402) and [Antoine Filipović-Pierucci](https://pierucci.github.io/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
